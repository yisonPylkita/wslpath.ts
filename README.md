# wslpath.ts - translate file system paths between WSL and Windows

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yisonPylkita/wslpath.ts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yisonPylkita/wslpath.ts)

I found few projects with the same aim but the were either written in something else than TypeScript/JavaScript or were just calling `wslpath` application to do path translation. After some profiling I found out that I could not afford to create new process with native `wslpath` application every time I needed path translation. So I decided to create this library.
